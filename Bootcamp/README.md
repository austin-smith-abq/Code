# The Manifesto, aka the most important part
## Part 1 - Why are we here?
This bootcamp is free. For the love of god, please stop spending $10,000 for 10 weeks of education. What are the educational backgrounds of the people teaching these classes? I don't know. But they're teaching a bootcamp.

Listen, from one you to another. I've been there. Changing careers because you hated your old job, didn't see a bright future, or just Googled TOP 10 Careers FOR 2022 because you're afraid of being outsourced or just want more money.

If any of the above describes you, this bootcamp, and coding in general is not for you. Keep searching, you'll find something that clicks eventually. But right now, the world doesn't need more people hopping on careers they have no passion about because they want money or to run away.

There is no amount of content that can be given out in the bootcamp you're considering taking out a loan to take that is remotely close to being worth what they're charging. Fact of the matter is, you can't learn to code in ten weeks. You can get started, but full stack you will not be. These bootcamps will give you twenty things to put on your resume, and you won't be able to explain what a single one of them is, why it's on your resume, and how it connects to your fullstack app.s

I've also been on the other side. I've interviewed tons of bootcamp graduates. When I'm interviewing, my hope is that I will find one person that has been coding for years, and is just trying to get this certificate as a last ditch attempt to have a certificate that says "I CAN CODE" so that an HR employee will see that and pass their resume on to their eventual manager instead of canning it straight away.

Instead, the candidates are people just looking to work from home. I get it, working from home is awesome. You can make coffee sometimes. But you're still working. If you're actively seeking a work from home environment without some external reason (taking care of a sick relative or new baby for example), I don't trust you to work at all. You won't just make coffee. You'll be living like it's the weekend, but responding to an email every now and again.

Instead, the candidates are people that got in a fight with their last boss, and have burned too many bridges in the past to continue their current career.

Instead, the candidates are people that bought into a sales pitch. Pay $10,000 now, you'll be making $160,000 in a year! You won't. Depending on where you live, those jobs don't exist. The ones that are hiring remotely have an entire planet for an applicant pool, so good luck with your ten weeks. The $160,000 jobs are in select areas of the country, and are highly competitive. You can get there, and I really hope you do. But you won't right away.

I've got some advice. Trust it or not. I'm the one not trying to make any money from you, so consider that. In fact, the past few paragraphs I've probably been making you feel bad or something. Sorry about that. I'm just really tired of seeing poorly designed apps being built by people that don't know what they're doing all while some bootcamp is galloping off to the bank. You're probably fine. My goal, and hopefully OUR goal, is to make the world just a little bit better and well designed. Make lives easier. Save some secretaries some money on carpal tunnel surgery. Technology isn't about money. It's about people.

## Part 2 - The advice
Okay, here's the advice I promised. When you're done with this bootcamp (I hate calling it that, we'll find a better word, but you know how SEO goes), you won't be qualified to work as a full-stack developer. But you sure as sunshine will be just as qualified to work as a full-stack developer as if you'd paid for a normal bootcamp. That's a pretty good deal. I might even say you will be substantially more qualified. But beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I probably won't be interviewing you. If I do, mention this bootcamp, it'll help your shots!

Step 1 - When you're done with this bootcamp, what you're going to do is take the first tech related job you can find (Unless you're already in one, then you're a couple legs ahead. Feel free to skip reading Step 1).

Step 2 - Only broke these up into steps just for that joke. Anyways, once you have an IT job, become the best in your building at it. If you're phone support, solve every ticket. Learn about DHCP. Learn more than your boss. Become essential. Be the only person that looks things up and learns. If you work anywhere and are constantly learning about what you do, you will know more than anyone else there in less than a year. I guarantee that.

Step 3 - Start combining your bootcamp knowledge with your computer knowledge. Build something useful. Build an app that saves coworkers time. Better yet, build an app that saves your boss time. Never EVER tell them that you're working on it until it's done, don't mention that you're coding anything at all to anyone. This is essential, the element of surprise is more powerful than your hollow promises. Before you show it to them, test it out. Make sure it's fast, everything works PERFECTLY and anticipate any requested features. Put those anticipated features in the app before showing it. Once it's COMPLETELY done, then show it to your boss. Within a few weeks, you will only be coding apps. Congratulations.

I guess you don't have to be in an IT field to do this, but the more you know about every facet of computers, the more powerful you will become. This course is designed to not really just make you a great front-end developer, but a great developer overall. Or a great sys admin. Many of these skills have significant use outside of building a front end application. If you can query a database, you can analyze data (I promise, it's true, and you'll be better at it than anyone you see on YouTube). If you're switching to Linux, you will be a better sys admin than anyone else in your workplace (I assure you, they took a Windows Server 2008 course back in 2009 and that's it).

#  The Learning Stuff, second most important. Course actually begins here.

## Part 1 - Wait did you just say I'm installing Linux? I didn't agree to this...
Yeah, I did say that. And you have agreed to it by reading this sentence. Also, if you are truly interested in becoming a developer of ANY kind, you have to learn Linux. If you read that whole manifesto part and didn't run away, you probably already have Linux installed. If you didn't read it, then go do that. And please stop skipping stuff. It is substantially easier to read these sentences than it is to go out and earn $10,000 for a bootcamp. If you skip around and get confused, sorry! Also the tone for this bootcamp won't be changing. Strap in.

We're installing Linux. I don't care what kind you use. They're all the same. I'd be crucified for saying this, but the only Linux users that could find my IP address are the Kali kids, and they can't read.

Take a USB, if you don't have one, go get one. Make it big enough to save and back up everything valuable you have on your computer. Pictures of family, friends, love letters. 256KB should be enough.

Go back to the store and get a second USB, this one 8GB. This is the one we're throwing a Linux ISO on. Google whatever distro you remember that one loser mentioning in college and the word ISO, and download from the first link that doesn't look suspect. Usually it'll be distroname.org. If you want some Linux distro recommendations I have some. Don't ever talk about a distro with anybody else, it will always be a fight, and they will always be wrong and pretentious if they disagree with this list.

- Arch Linux (don't worry I hate myself). If you have NO experience with Linux, this will be the most painful time of your life. You'll need to start over several times. Follow a YouTube tutorial to the tee. It still won't work quite right, but in getting this installed, you just learned a lot. You don't know it, but you did.

- Manjaro. If you want all of the coolness that comes with installing Arch, but still have an occasional hankering for downing a whole bottle of Elmer's glue. This will give you a pre-installed and working install of Arch, complete with a desktop environment (dude, those people above just spent 5 hours getting Arch installed, only to find that it JUST comes with a terminal).

- Ubuntu. Easiest to get started with. Probably my honest to god recommendation. You'll get bullied a little bit, but only by Linux users. So they're really only bullying a mirror (editor's note: great joke).

Don't use Red Hat (they're about as open with their source as my ex-wife is with our kids on holidays) (don't have an ex-wife or kids, just a sense of humor).

Don't use Gentoo, or anything more complicated than Arch. You will actually die if it's your first install. If you're not sure, just use Ubuntu. It's okay. We keep secrets here.

## Part 2 - Okay, I have my ISO
Excellent job on selecting Ubuntu.
